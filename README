This is the top-level repository for EFM32 / EFR software development.

To get started, clone this repository. The other repositories are submodules
in this project. It is unlikely that you will need all the submodules 
included in the default git repository. Feel free to remove them. It is
likely that you will need at least CMSIS/, Device/ and emlib/.
